As it's with no difficulty.

# Basic Math and Logic

## Some Notation

* Difference between

$$
  \forall x,\exists y \ s.t. \ y>x. \\
  and\\
  \exists y \ s.t. \ y>x,\forall x.
$$

* Sequence and index
* Summation
   $$
    \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i!}=e 
   $$

## Formal Logic

* Equivalent
  $$
   \iff iff. 
  $$
* Converse,inverse and contrapositive
  
$$
   A \Rightarrow B  \\
    Converse:B \Rightarrow A\\
    Inverse: \lnot A \Rightarrow  \lnot B  \\
    Contrapositive:\lnot B \Rightarrow \lnot A 
$$

$$
 \lnot (\forall x,s.t.\ x\ has\ property\ A)\\
 \iff \\
 \exists x,s.t.\ \lnot (x\ has\ property\ A) 
$$

## Proof Techniques

There are many different ways to prove a theorem;sometimes more than one method will work.There are five main techniques:

1. Proof by counterexample.
   Not every continuous function is differentiable.
2. Proof by contrapositive.
   $$For\ any\ two\ numbers\ x\ and\ y,\\x = y,\ if\ and\ only\ if\ \forall \epsilon,|x-y|<\epsilon$$
3. Proof by contradiction.
   $$
    \sqrt{2}\ is\ not \ a \ rational\ number. 
   $$
4. Proof by induction.
5. Direct proof in two steps.
